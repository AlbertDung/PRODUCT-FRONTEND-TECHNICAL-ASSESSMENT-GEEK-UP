# Technical Approach Document

## Core Technologies

### React + TypeScript + Vite
- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, large ecosystem, and excellent developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, better IDE support, and helps catch errors during development
- **Vite**: Selected for its extremely fast development server and optimized build process

## Key Libraries and Tools

### State Management
- **React Query**: For efficient server state management and data fetching
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management solution for client-side state

### UI Components and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Headless UI**: Unstyled, accessible components that work with Tailwind CSS
- **React Icons**: Comprehensive icon library

### Form Handling
- **React Hook Form**: For efficient form handling with minimal re-renders
- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code linting and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **SWC**: Fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler

### Testing
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **MSW**: API mocking for testing

## Why These Choices?

1. **Vite over Create React App**
   - Faster development server
   - Better hot module replacement
   - More modern build tooling

2. **TypeScript**
   - Catches errors early in development
   - Improves code maintainability
   - Better IDE support and developer experience

3. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Rapid development with utility classes
   - No need to write custom CSS
   - Consistent design system

4. **React Query**
   - Efficient data fetching and caching
   - Automatic background updates
   - Built-in error handling

5. **Zustand**
   - Simpler than Redux
   - No boilerplate code
   - Easy integration with TypeScript

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint for code linting
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - TypeScript for type checking
   - Husky for pre-commit hooks

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests with Vitest
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for critical user flows

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Code splitting with React.lazy
   - Image optimization
   - Bundle size monitoring

## Future Considerations

1. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add end-to-end testing with Cypress
   - Implement PWA capabilities
   - Add internationalization support

2. **Scalability**
   - Micro-frontend architecture if needed
   - Server-side rendering for better SEO
   - Performance monitoring tools
